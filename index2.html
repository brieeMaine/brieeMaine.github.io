<h3>Naked Wines sells the best wine you've ever tasted.</h3>

<p>Quite a claim, huh? Here's why we think it's true...

It turns out that the very best wines are made with love and passion by a real winemaker, and not by a supermarket salesman.

What’s more, when you give a talented winemaker the funds they need and then make them accountable for how the wine tastes to the people that funded them… the results are incredible.

Our customers, called Angels, crowdfund independent winemakers to make them exclusive, delicious wines in exchange for preferential prices.

Winemakers and Angels are directly connected on our website, sharing their views, ratings and suggestions with each other. Think of it as a dating agency for winemakers and wine drinkers!

Launched in Australia in 2012 after a successful five years in the UK, Naked Wines Angels have already invested over $30m in Australian winemakers.</p>

<h3>Do you agree that when it comes to customer experience, just okay is not okay?</h3>

<p>At Naked Wines we keep trying to do things better. We can't help ourselves. One of these things is delivering an award-winning, world-class experience to our customers. Do you like putting a smile on people's faces? Do you want to be the very best? Well read on, because Naked Wines is hiring.</p>

<h3>What will your role involve at Naked?</h3>

<p>- Speaking with our best customers, our Angels, to ensure they are getting everything they need from Naked, on top of amazing wines.
- Creating customer lifetime value by turning any negative experience into a positive one, through delivering a mind-blowing customer experience through wine recommendations.
- Learning about our amazing winemakers and tasting their wines, and passing this passion on to our Angels (wine snobs need not apply)
- Working as part of an amazing team and making a difference to our customers’ and winemakers’ lives.
- Making recommendations on all of our wines based on customer tastes and preferences. 
What you can expect from a career at Naked

- Awesome training and opportunities to travel to vineyards and our US and UK offices.

<h3>Skills and expertise</h3>

<p>The successful candidate will need to be adaptable and a quick learner. We will teach you all about our wines (with lots of sampling!), however you don’t need to be a wine geek. This is a KPI based role, so sales experience is preferred, although not essential.</p>
